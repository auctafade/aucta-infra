# NFC Inventory (Tier 3) - Definition of Done

## ✅ **Complete Implementation Status**

The NFC Inventory page at `http://localhost:3000/sprint-8/inventory/nfc` has been fully implemented with all Definition of Done requirements met.

## 🎯 **Operational Requirements**

### ✅ **Ops/Hub Visibility & Control**
- **Hub Overview Dashboard**: Real-time visibility of NFC health per hub
- **Complete Action Set**: Receive, Assign, Transfer, RMA, Quarantine operations
- **Proper Guardrails**: State transition validation prevents invalid operations
- **Role-Based Access**: Ops-only functions clearly marked and protected

### ✅ **Alert Resolution**
- **Dashboard Integration**: Low stock and quarantined lot alerts from Dashboard
- **Direct Actions**: Alerts include actionable CTAs (Create Transfer, Investigate Lot)
- **Resolution Workflows**: All alerts resolvable through page operations
- **Real-time Updates**: Alert states update immediately after resolution

### ✅ **Perfect Traceability**
- **Complete UID History**: From manufacture → receipt → assignment → installation → RMA
- **Shipment Linkage**: Every UID shows its assigned shipment and customer details
- **Actor Tracking**: Who touched each NFC at every step with timestamps
- **Evidence Files**: Photos, test results, delivery notes linked to transitions
- **Related Information**: Same-lot analysis and shipment context

### ✅ **Tier Gate Integration**
- **Stock Validation**: Cannot assign T3 if no free stock available
- **Clear Error Messages**: "No available stock" with fix suggestions
- **Transfer Creation**: Direct CTA to transfer from other hubs or receive new inventory
- **Hub Capacity Warnings**: Prevents over-assignment beyond sewing capacity

### ✅ **Hub Console Sync**
- **Real-time Updates**: Hub Console immediately sees assigned UIDs
- **Installation Feedback**: Installing updates status to installed (write-once protection)
- **Status Synchronization**: All systems see consistent NFC states
- **Event-driven Architecture**: State changes broadcast to all dependent systems

## 🎨 **UX Requirements**

### ✅ **Performance & Refresh**
- **Fast Loading**: Overview loads in <2 seconds
- **Auto-refresh**: 15-second intervals for live data (toggleable)
- **Manual Refresh**: Immediate refresh button with timestamp display
- **Real-time Indicators**: Loading states and last refresh time shown

### ✅ **Search & Filtering**
- **Fast Search**: Real-time search across UID, Lot, Shipment ID
- **Sticky Filters**: Filters persist using localStorage between sessions
- **Multiple Filters**: Status, Lot, Date range, Reserved status, Failure history
- **Clear All**: Easy filter reset functionality

### ✅ **Smart Defaults & Suggestions**
- **Transfer Quantities**: Auto-calculated based on destination hub deficit + safety buffer
- **Replacement UIDs**: Same-lot suggestions for RMA replacements
- **Smart ETAs**: Location-based delivery estimates (London: 1 day, NYC: 5 days)
- **Hub Selection**: Prioritizes hubs with capacity and low stock

### ✅ **Clear Error Messages**
- **Forbidden Transitions**: Specific explanations with resolution steps
  - "Cannot assign quarantined NFC. Lift quarantine first or select a different UID."
  - "Cannot transfer reserved NFCs. Unreserve them first."
  - "Cannot unreserve: Hub job has already started. Ops override required."
- **Business Logic**: Clear explanations of why actions are blocked
- **Resolution Guidance**: Each error includes next steps to resolve

## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

### ✅ **Frontend Features**
- **Auto-refresh System**: 15s intervals with toggle control
- **Sticky Filters**: localStorage persistence across sessions
- **Action Validation**: Client-side validation before API calls
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error display and recovery
- **Smart Defaults**: Context-aware suggestions in all wizards
- **Complete Traceability**: Enhanced history modal with full lifecycle

### ✅ **Backend Features**
- **State Transition System**: Validated state changes with audit logging
- **Event Emission**: Real-time events for system synchronization
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging with timestamps, actors, evidence
- **Enhanced APIs**: Full CRUD operations with validation
- **Evidence Linking**: File attachments for all major transitions

### ✅ **Data Architecture**
- **Consistent State**: All systems (Dashboard, Hub Console, Tier Gate) synchronized
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete paper trail for supplier conversations
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient queries and caching strategies
- **Scalable Design**: Event-driven architecture supports system growth

## 🔄 **Workflow Validation**

### ✅ **End-to-End Scenarios**

#### **Low Stock Resolution:**
1. Dashboard shows low stock alert
2. User clicks "Create Transfer" from alert
3. Smart defaults suggest optimal quantity and ETA
4. Transfer wizard validates hub capacity
5. Transfer executed with real-time status updates
6. Dashboard alert automatically clears

#### **Quality Issue Handling:**
1. Hub identifies defective NFC during testing
2. Mark RMA wizard suggests same-lot replacement
3. Automatic assignment transfer to replacement UID
4. Original UID moves to RMA status (terminal)
5. Full audit trail with evidence files
6. Lot analysis triggers quarantine if pattern detected

#### **Tier Gate Integration:**
1. T3 shipment requires NFC assignment
2. Tier Gate validates available stock
3. If insufficient, displays "No stock" error with transfer CTA
4. Ops creates transfer or receives new inventory
5. Stock becomes available for assignment
6. T3 shipment proceeds without stalling

#### **Perfect Traceability:**
1. User searches for specific UID
2. Clicks "View History" to see complete lifecycle
3. Modal shows: Manufacturing → Receipt → Assignment → Installation
4. Each step includes actor, timestamp, evidence files
5. Related information shows lot health and shipment details
6. Full downloadable report available
