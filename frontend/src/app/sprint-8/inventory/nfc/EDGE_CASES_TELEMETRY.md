# NFC Inventory - Edge Cases & Telemetry

## ðŸš¨ **Edge Cases Implementation**

### âœ… **1. UID Not Found at Install**

**Scenario**: During sewing process, assigned NFC cannot be located or is damaged.

**Solution**: Quick replacement workflow with audit trail.

#### **Features:**
- **Fast Replacement**: Select same-lot NFC with immediate assignment transfer
- **Audit Trail**: Original UID marked as lost/RMA with reason
- **Evidence Linking**: Connect replacement to original shipment
- **Incident Generation**: Automatic tracking for patterns

#### **Workflow:**
```
1. Hub Console reports missing UID during install
2. Operator opens "UID Not Found" modal
3. System suggests same-lot replacements
4. Automatic actions:
   - Mark original UID as lost/RMA
   - Assign replacement to same shipment  
   - Update audit trail with linkage
   - Generate incident report
```

#### **Reasons Tracked:**
- Lost in Transit
- Damaged on Arrival  
- Not Found in Package
- Inventory Discrepancy
- Other (with notes)

### âœ… **2. Inter-Hub Transfer Stuck**

**Scenario**: Transfer is overdue (>3 days past ETA), partial delivery, or lost in transit.

**Solution**: Proactive alerts with resolution workflows.

#### **Features:**
- **Automatic Detection**: System flags transfers overdue by 2+ days
- **Partial Arrival Handling**: Accept arrived UIDs, RMA missing ones
- **Investigation Workflow**: Open carrier incident for lost shipments
- **Transfer Tracking**: Real-time status updates and ETA monitoring

#### **Resolution Options:**
1. **Mark Partial Arrival**: 
   - Accept received UIDs
   - Mark missing UIDs as lost in transit
   - Auto-RMA processing

2. **Open Investigation**:
   - Create incident report
   - Coordinate with carrier/logistics
   - Track resolution progress

#### **Telemetry Tracked:**
- Transfer duration times
- Success/failure rates
- Carrier performance metrics
- Hub-to-hub reliability

---

### âœ… **3. Supplier Recall**

**Scenario**: Manufacturing defect or quality issue requires immediate lot quarantine.

**Solution**: Comprehensive impact analysis with automatic quarantine.

#### **Features:**
- **Impact Analysis**: Real-time calculation of affected units
- **Customer Impact**: Shows affected shipments and customers
- **Automatic Actions**: Quarantine available stock, flag reservations
- **Supplier Integration**: Quality incident creation

#### **Impact Analysis:**
- **Total Affected UIDs**: All NFCs in recalled lot
- **Reserved Shipments**: Count and customer breakdown
- **Already Installed**: Units remain active (RMA only on failure)
- **Available Stock**: Immediate quarantine
- **Customer Notifications**: Auto-generated impact reports

#### **Automatic Quarantine Actions:**
- Quarantine all available NFCs in lot
- Block new assignments from lot
- Flag reserved shipments for replacement
- Generate customer notification reports
- Create supplier quality incident
- Preserve installed units (controlled RMA)

---

### âœ… **4. Duplicate UID Import**

**Scenario**: CSV import contains UIDs already in system, causing conflicts.

**Solution**: Conflict detection with resolution options.

#### **Features:**
- **Duplicate Detection**: Pre-import validation scanning
- **Conflict Resolution**: Choose to block or import valid only
- **Correction Guidance**: Downloadable corrected file
- **Pattern Analysis**: Detect systematic UID collisions

#### **Resolution Options:**
1. **Block Import**: 
   - Reject entire upload
   - Require file correction
   - Provide duplicate list

2. **Import Valid Only**:
   - Process non-duplicate UIDs
   - Skip conflicts
   - Generate correction report

#### **Prevention Measures:**
- Supplier UID generation verification
- Import validation enhancement
- Systematic collision pattern detection
- Future duplicate prevention

---

### âœ… **5. Cross-Hub Assignment Attempt**

**Scenario**: User attempts to assign NFC from different hub to local shipment.

**Solution**: Block with clear transfer suggestion.

#### **Features:**
- **Hub Validation**: Check NFC location vs current hub
- **Clear Error Messages**: Explain location mismatch
- **Transfer Suggestion**: Direct path to inter-hub transfer
- **Location Display**: Show current vs required hub

#### **Error Message:**
```
"Cannot assign NFC from different hub. NFC is at London Hub, 
but you're managing Paris Hub. Transfer the NFC first, then assign."
```

#### **Resolution Path:**
1. User clicks "Transfer First" button
2. Opens transfer modal with pre-filled data
3. Complete transfer to current hub
4. Retry assignment after arrival
