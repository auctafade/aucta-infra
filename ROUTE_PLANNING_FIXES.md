## ✅ **SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:**

### 1. **Fixed Pricing Calculation System**
- ✅ **Real Transport Costs**: Flights (€285), Trains (€150), Ground transport (€0.50/km)
- ✅ **Operator Labor**: €65/hour regular + €97.50/hour overtime + €105 per diem
- ✅ **Hub Processing Fees**: Tier 3 auth (€100), Tier 2 auth (€75), Sewing (€150)
- ✅ **Last-Mile Costs**: Pickup (€75), Delivery (€85), Return journey calculated
- ✅ **Realistic Surcharges**: Peak season (15%), Weekend (€75), Fragile (1%), Fuel (5%)
- ✅ **Proper Insurance**: 0.3% of declared value, minimum €25

### 2. **Fixed ETA & Date Calculations**

  - Operator costs with hours breakdown
  - Transport costs by mode (flights/trains/ground)
  - Hub processing fees by service
  - Authentication hardware costs
  - Comprehensive surcharges
- ✅ **Operational Timeline**:
  - Step-by-step execution plan
  - Checkpoints for operators
  - Responsible parties identified
  - Time estimates and locations
- ✅ **Export Functionality**:
  - Cost breakdown → CSV for accounting
  - Timeline → CSV for operations (Lina)
  - Operational manifest generation

- Tier 2: All routes show A→HubId→B end-to-end only
- No DHL between hubs in any Tier 3 route

### ✅ **Operations Support:**
- Exportable cost breakdowns for accounting
- Exportable timelines for field operations
- Step-by-step execution plans with checkpoints
- Ready for operational deployment
